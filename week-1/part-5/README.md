# Week 1 Part 5

## Assignment

### Step 1: Get Key Visuals

Key visuals are located in the top of the homepage. There will be many key visuals for marketing activities, but we just show one at a time.

Connect to `List Key Visuals API` by AJAX for the links, stories and image paths.  
Refer to: https://github.com/AppWorks-School/Front-End-Class-2018-Summer/blob/master/RESTful.md#list-key-visuals

Build key visuals layout dynamically.  
If user click on one of them, send user to the corresponding link.

### Step 2: Slide Effect

Complete slide effect on the key visuals.  
We should change to next slide every 10 seconds automatically.
