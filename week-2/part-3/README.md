# Week 2 Part 3

## Assignment

### Step 1: Handle Product Variants

Every product has variants. It means every product has different colors and sizes.  
We should build an UI for user to choose their favorite color and size in the product page.

#### Complete it!

Refer to [Zeplin](https://github.com/AppWorks-School/Front-End-Class-2018-Summer/blob/master/week-1/part-2/README.md#what-we-have) for design of details.

### Step 2: Handle Stock of Product Variants

Every variant has its' own `stock record` which we have taken from `Product Details API`.
We should handle stock record carefully:

1. Stock record makes the limit of quantity user can buy at one time.
2. If a variant is out of stock, user cannot choose that faded one.
